  Switch to astro

Astro.js is awesome.

Why I choose Astro.js instead hugo or zola?
- great Markdown support as smilar as hugo/zola
- much flexible to customize
  - like Islands to support multiple UI frameworks like React, Preact, Svelte, Vue, and SolidJS. I'm not a frontend guy, the flexible ability that me to switch between those JS UI frameworks.
- SSG (Static-Site Generating)
  - easy for me to deploy to Github Pages.

But Hugo and Zola still have some small advantages:
- easy to switch themes
- data / layout are much independent
